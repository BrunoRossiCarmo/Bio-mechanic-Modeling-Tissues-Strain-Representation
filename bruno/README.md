# Notes:

Hello guys! Here I dropped all of the files since I started to develop this work. The last two files (V1.0_M1 E V1.0_M2) are the files about two tissue with different conformation, so they are the final files on our 3D representation. 

# V1.0_M1:

This file shows a 3D representation of a tissue being compressed by some actuator. By this way, we use to calculate the Stress and Strain by the information of this tissue, representing a elastic tissue with poisson's ratio equal to 0.5 and Young's Module equals to 10000kPa.
