# Notes:

Hello guys! Here I dropped all of the files since I started to develop this work. The last two files (V1.0_M1 E V1.0_M2) are the files about two tissue with different conformation, so they are the final files on our 3D representation.

*V1.0_M1:*
*This file shows a 3D representation of a tissue being compressed by an actuator. In this way, we calculate the Stress and Strain by the information of this tissue, representing an elastic tissue with poisson's ratio equal to 0.5 and Young's Module equals to 10000kPa. Futhermore, the Stress shows the equation: S = E * e, where "E" is Strain and "e" is the Young's Module.*

*Pt_br: Esse arquivo representa um tecido sendo comprimido por um atuador. Deste modo, calculamos a Deformação e o Estresse do tecido, este sendo um tecido elástico não linear com coeficiente de Poisson igual a 0.5 e Módulo de Young com 10000kPa.*
