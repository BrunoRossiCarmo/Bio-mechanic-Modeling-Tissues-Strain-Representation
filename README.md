# Bio-mechanic-Modeling-Tissues-Strain-Representation

The main objetive here is to create a 3D environment of a tissue being compressed by an applicator. Furthermore, we'll try to simulate a elastic tissue , non-elastic tissue and at the last, a visco-elastic tissue modeling using Vpython and ploting some StrainXStress graphs with matlabplot.
